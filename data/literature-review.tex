\chapter{Introduction}

Convolutional neural networks have shown a high performance in a variety of tasks during recent decade. Power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is mainly due to their ability to aggregate and generalize local features. It turns out that CNN architecture is extremely good and effective when we deal with \textit{structured data}. In early beginning of CNNs milestone works were VGG-19 \cite{Simonyan_Zisserman_2015} and AlexNet \cite{Krizhevsky_Sutskever_Hinton_2017}, where authors proved that convolutional architectures can be way more computationally effective than we thought before. It has also been shown that learned convolutional filters can reflect a local structure of sample.

Nowadays CNNs are used in a variety of tasks such as classification,  image generation, clustering, dimensionality reduction etc. One of possible applications of CNN is neural image compression. In neural image compression we use a compression power of convolutional neural network, which is a stack of convolutional layers, such as \cite{Krizhevsky_Sutskever_Hinton_2017}.
